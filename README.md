<h2>
<strong>Advanced Rules</strong></h2>


<ol>

<li><strong>Deck Construction</strong></li> 
<ol>
 
<li>You can never play more than 1 copy of a card; no cards are “unbound.”</li>
 
<li>The Main Deck is 60 cards: 59 cards and 1 Deck Master.</li>
 
<li>The Extra Deck can have any number of cards between 0 and 15.</li>
 
<li>Players may not use a Side Deck. Players cannot swap cards in and out of their Main Deck between games in a match.</li>
 
<li>Unless Forbidden, all cards are limited to 1 copy per deck.</li>
 
<li>Forbidden cards cannot be used.</li> 
</ol>

<li><strong>Deck Masters</strong></li> 
<ol>
 
<li><strong>Deck Master Legality</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>The Deck Master must be a monster card able to be Normal Summoned or Set.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters cannot be Deck Masters.</li>
   
<li>Monsters whose text states they cannot be Normal Summoned/Set, such as “Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning” cannot be Deck Masters.</li>
   
<li>Monsters with conditions to be Normal Summoned or Set, like Cave Dragon, can be Deck Masters.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>The Deck Master is declared before the match begins.</li>
  
<li>The Deck Master cannot change between games.</li>  
</ol>
 
<li><strong>Extra Monster Zone</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>The Deck Master begins the game in the Extra Monster Zone.</li>
  
<li>While in the EMZ, your Deck Master…</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>Is not treated as being on the field.</li>
   
<li>Cannot activate nor apply any of its effects.</li>
   
<li>Cannot be targeted or affected by other cards.</li>
   
<li>Cannot leave the EMZ through any method besides being normal summoned or set.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>Players cannot summon to an EMZ while a Deck Master occupies it.</li>  
</ol>
 
<li><strong>Summoning the Deck Master</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>You must follow the summoning condition for a Deck Master.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>Your Deck Master cannot leave the EMZ through any method besides being normal summoned or set.</li>
   
<li>For example, If a DM is level 5 or higher and must be tribute summoned, you still need to tribute monsters to summon it. </li>
   
<li>Similarly, Ghostrick Siren cannot be normal summoned from the EMZ unless you control a Ghostrick monster.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>Shuffling a card from your hand into the deck to summon the Deck Master from the EMZ is a summoning condition.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>For example, if the opponent uses Forced Back to negate the normal summon of your Deck Master, you still shuffle a card from your hand into the deck.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>Once a Deck Master has been summoned, it’s treated like any other monster and follows normal game mechanics. It cannot return to the EMZ.</li>  
</ol></li>  
</ol>

<li><strong>Summon Limit</strong></li> 
<ol>
 
<li><strong>“Neither player can Normal/Special Summon more than X Monsters each turn.”</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>While their opponent's LP are…
<p>

            Greater than or equal to 4000, X=2
</p>
<p>

            Less than 4000, X=3
</p>
<p>

            Less than 2000, X=4
</p></li>
  
<li>Normal Summoning or Setting the Deck Master from the EMZ counts as 2 toward the summon limit.</li>  
</ol>
 
<li><strong>Types of Summon</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>The Summon Limit only counts Normal and Special Summons.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>Tribute Summons are Normal Summons.</li>
   
<li>Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, and Link Summons are Special Summons.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>Setting a monster as a normal set does not count towards the Limit.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>Setting the Deck Master from the Extra Monster Zone counts as 2 toward the Summon Limit.</li>
   
<li>Effects which Special Summon an effect monster face-down do count towards the Summon Limit.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>Flip summons do not count towards the Summon Limit.</li>  
</ol>
 
<li><strong>Tokens</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>Tokens do not count toward the Summon Limit.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>Each Player may summon any number of Tokens each turn.</li>   
</ol></li>   
</ol>
 
<li><strong>Simultaneous Summons</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>Multiple monsters summoned simultaneously count as multiple monsters toward the summon limit.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>Pendulum Summoning 2 effect monsters at once counts as 2 Summons.</li>   
</ol></li>   
</ol>
 
<li><strong>Reaching the limit</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>The summon limit can change during a turn.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>For example, if Player A summons their 2nd monster that turn and attacks Player B who has 4000 LP, dropping Player B to 3500, Player A can now summon a 3rd monster this turn.</li>
   
<li>Similarly, if Player A has summoned 2 monsters, and their opponent has 3500 life points, when they activate “Monster Reborn,” Player B can chain “Aegis of Gaia” to increase their Life Points above 4000 and cause Monster Reborn to resolve without effect due to the summon limit now being 2.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>A player who has already reached the current Summon Limit cannot attempt to summon another monster in that turn.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>For example, a player who has already summoned 2 monsters in a turn cannot attempt to activate <a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=11268">Shaddoll Fusion</a> while their opponent’s life points are 4000.</li>
   
<li>If a mandatory effect to summon a monster is activated, (<em>such as “<a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=7596">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a></em>”), and the player attempting to summon that monster has already reached their Summon Limit, that mandatory effect will activate, but resolve without effect.</li>   
</ol></li>   
</ol>
 
<li><strong>Negated Summons</strong></li>  
<ol>
  
<li>Negated summons do not count towards the Limit. </li>
  
<li>Negated cards/effects do not count towards the Limit.</li>
  
<li>Negated Summons of a monster(s) do not count towards the Limit.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>The summon of <a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=5833">Chaos Sorcerer</a> negated by <a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=9008">Solemn Warning</a> does not count towards the limit.</li>   
</ol>
  
<li>Negated cards/effects which could summon a monster(s) do not count towards the Limit.</li>   
<ol>
   
<li>“<a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=11840">Brilliant Fusion</a>” which does not resolve will not count towards the limit.</li>
   
<li>“<a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=11268">Shaddoll Fusion</a>” negated by “<a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=9008">Solemn Warning</a>” will <em>not</em> count towards the limit.</li>   
</ol></li>   
</ol></li>   
</ol>

<li><strong>Nightfall</strong></li> 
<ol>
 
<li>The “text” of Nightfall reads:</li>  
<ol>
  
<li>Once per turn, pay 500 LP and flip 1 card your opponent controls face-down, ignoring all other card effects. Nightfall does not start a Chain and is not a card effect.</li>  
</ol>
 
<li>Nightfall is used by declaring its use and setting 1 card your opponent controls face down.</li>
 
<li>Nightfall can be used on monsters, spells, and traps. If used on a monster, the monster is changed to face-down defense position. Otherwise, the spell or trap is flipped face down.</li>
 
<li>Nightfall cannot be used on Link monsters.</li>
 
<li>Nightfall is considered a game rules action, and is not a card or effect.</li>
 
<li>Nightfall does not target.</li>
 
<li>Nightfall ignores all card text.</li>  
<ol>
  
<li>This includes cards which would otherwise be unaffected or unable to be set, and Continuous Restriction effects such as “Light of Intervention.”</li>  
</ol>
 
<li>Nightfall does not start a chain.</li>  
<ol>
  
<li>Effects that trigger on a new chain upon seeing a card flipped face down, such as “Subterror Usamatryx”, may still trigger after Nightfall is used.</li>  
</ol></li>  
</ol></li>  
</ol>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>


<p>
<strong>Highlander</strong>
</p>
<p>
Card games are at their most interesting in the deck builder. By requiring that players fill their decks with 60 unique cards, highlander brewers are rewarded for their knowledge of the card pool. Singleton formats require a deep understanding of what makes strategies synergize with one another, and the feeling of seeing creative ideas come together into one coherent gameplan is what makes Yugioh so satisfying.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Deck Master</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the worst feelings in card games is when you lose the duel from the opening hand because your opponent opened their engine and you didn’t. Deck Masters help both players to access their engine’s starter from the get go. With Deck Masters, more games feature both duelist’s strategies duking it out to see which is more powerful.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Summon Limit</strong>
</p>
<p>
Modern Yugioh is so powercrept that it hardly resembles the game it once was. By capping the number of summons a player can perform in a turn, the game slows down, and the solitaire-like turns of modern Yugioh are replaced with more grindy, high-turn-count duels.
</p>
<p>
By tying the summon limit to Life Points, the pace of the game gradually accelerates as the duel progresses. Life Point management, which is usually irrelevant so long as you don’t let them hit 0, is now a relevant skill. The decision to pay Life Points for the cost of game mechanics like Nightfall, or for powerful spells like Instant Fusion, now carry actual weight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nightfall</strong>
</p>
<p>
Because of the summon limit, both players are always playing under a universal floodgate. Once one player establishes a board or begins to snowball, duels can quickly become insurmountable as the opponent needs to mount a comeback against a summon limit and the opponent’s disruptions. Nightfall gives players a way to flip monsters with Quick-Effect disruptions face down, helping to create back-and-forth duels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
TRH’s rules are all geared toward fixing the core issues with Trinity Format. Trinity struggles to balance for modern Yugioh’s increasingly powerful boss monsters and floodgates, so Nightfall has been added to provide counterplay. Trinity games are too often decided by which player starts with access to their engine, so Deck Masters have been added to improve consistency. Trinity Format struggles with players snowballing advantage too quickly, so the summon limit now starts smaller and increases gradually as the game progresses.
